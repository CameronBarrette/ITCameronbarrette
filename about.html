  <h1>About Me – My Journey Into IT & Cybersecurity</h1>

<p>
My name is Cameron Barrette, and I am from Charlotte, Michigan. I am currently pursuing
a career in IT and cybersecurity through hands-on training at Job Corps while also
building my skills independently through platforms like TryHackMe. I am focused on
developing strong foundations in networking, systems, and security as I work toward
industry certifications and long-term career growth.
</p>

<p>
My ultimate goal is to join the military to further my education and experience in the
IT and cybersecurity field while serving my country. I am driven by discipline,
structure, and continuous self-improvement, which is what led me to enroll in Job Corps
to take my career path seriously and gain real technical skills.
</p>

<p>
Outside of technology, I value hard work and responsibility. I purchased my first home
at 21 years old and have since owned two homes, experiences that taught me financial
discipline and maturity at a young age. I also enjoy working out and playing basketball,
activities that help me stay focused, motivated, and mentally sharp.
</p>

<p>
During my time at Job Corps, I have been recognized multiple times for my determination,
work ethic, and commitment to learning. I have received praise from instructors and
earned awards for consistently putting in the effort to improve and succeed in my
training.
</p>

<p>
I am committed to building a future in cybersecurity where I can protect systems,
networks, and data while continuing to grow both professionally and personally.
