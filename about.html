<h1>About Me – My Journey Into IT & Cybersecurity</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
My name is Cameron Barrette, and I am an aspiring IT and cybersecurity professional from
Charlotte, Michigan. I am currently developing my technical skills through hands-on training
at Job Corps while building a strong foundation in networking, system administration, and 
cybersecurity principles.
</p>

<p>
I am passionate about understanding how systems work, how they are protected, and how
technology can be used to solve real-world problems. Every day, I focus on learning 
something new that brings me closer to becoming a skilled and reliable IT professional.
</p>

<h2>Education & Technical Training</h2>
<p>
I am enrolled in the IT/Cybersecurity trade at Job Corps, where I am gaining structured, 
practical experience with:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Networking fundamentals</li>
<li>System configuration and troubleshooting</li>
<li>IT security concepts and risk management</li>
<li>Hardware and software environments</li>
<li>Preparing for industry certifications</li>
<li>Professional workplace skills and IT career readiness</li>
</ul>

<p>
This training has helped me understand not just how technology works, but why it works 
the way it does.
</p>

<h2>Technical Skills & Areas of Focus</h2>
<p>I am actively building knowledge and experience in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer networking basics</li>
<li>Operating systems and system administration</li>
<li>Cybersecurity fundamentals and threat awareness</li>
<li>Problem-solving and technical troubleshooting</li>
<li>Understanding how systems communicate and are secured</li>
<li>Learning how real IT environments operate</li>
</ul>

<p>
I enjoy learning the “behind the scenes” of technology and how different components
come together to create secure and efficient systems.
</p>

<h2>Goals & Aspirations</h2>
<p>
My long-term goal is to build a career in IT and cybersecurity where I can help 
protect systems, networks, and data from threats while continuing to grow professionally.
</p>

<p>
After completing my training, I plan to pursue advanced IT training and eventually 
enter military service in a technical role. I believe the military will further 
strengthen my discipline, leadership, and technical skills while allowing me to serve 
a greater purpose.
</p>

<p>
I am committed to continuous improvement and lifelong learning in the technology field.
</p>

<h2>Work Ethic & Personal Values</h2>
<p>
I take pride in being dependable, disciplined, and hardworking. I have been
recognized during my training for my determination, willingness to learn, and 
ability to stay focused on my goals.
</p>

<p>
Purchasing my first home at a young age and taking on adult responsibilities 
early in life taught me financial responsibility, maturity, and long-term 
planning. These experiences shaped my mindset and taught me the value of 
accountability and perseverance.
</p>

<h2>Beyond Technology</h2>
<p>
Outside of IT, I enjoy working out and playing basketball. These activities 
help me maintain discipline, teamwork, and mental focus — qualities that carry 
over into my professional life. I believe staying physically active supports a 
strong and focused mindset.
</p>

<h2>Why I Built This Website</h2>
<p>
I created this portfolio website to document my journey into IT and 
cybersecurity, showcase my progress, and demonstrate my commitment to 
this career path. This site reflects both my technical growth and my 
dedication to becoming a professional in the field.
</p>
