  <h1>About Me – My Journey Into IT & Cybersecurity</h1>

<p>
My name is Cameron Barrette, and I am an aspiring IT and cybersecurity professional from
Charlotte, Michigan. I am currently advancing my technical skills through hands-on training
at Job Corps and practical labs on platforms like TryHackMe, where I focus on networking,
system fundamentals, and cybersecurity challenges.
</p>

<p>
I am committed to building a career in IT and cybersecurity where I can protect systems, 
networks, and data while continuing to grow professionally. My ultimate goal is to serve 
in the military in a technical role that further strengthens my skills and discipline.
</p>

<p>
Beyond technology, I value hard work, responsibility, and continuous improvement. I 
purchased my first home at 21 and have since owned two, experiences that taught me 
financial discipline, resilience, and maturity early in life.
</p>

<p>
During my time at Job Corps, I have been recognized for my determination, work ethic,
and commitment to learning. In every environment, I strive to bring integrity, 
collaboration, and a proactive mindset to every task.
</p>

<p>
I am committed to building a future in cybersecurity where I can protect systems,
networks, and data while continuing to grow both professionally and personally.
</p>

<p>Technical Skills: Networking basics • System administration fundamentals • Cybersecurity labs & simulations • Preparing for industry certifications
